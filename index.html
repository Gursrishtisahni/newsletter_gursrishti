        <h2>Revisiting the undercover Alito recording, post-Trump v. United States</h2>
        <p>The Supreme Court stunned legal experts last week by deeming presidents absolutely immune from prosecution for “core” constitutional duties and mostly immune for “official acts.” Otherwise, the court’s conservative majority reasoned, the prospect of criminal charges would make presidents less “energetic.”

            But when it comes to the energy levels and effectiveness of reporters performing their own core constitutional duty — tracking down important news, including about the Supreme Court — it seems many journalistic ethicists don’t share similar concerns.</p>

        <h2>Supreme Court reaffirms press precedent in social media cases</h2>
        <p>The Supreme Court reinforced key protections for the news media in yesterday’s decision on social media content moderation and the First Amendment. It made clear that, just as the government can’t force a newspaper to print something its editors don’t want to print, the government can’t force online platforms to carry content they don’t want to carry.

            The decision is a win that will help protect free speech, including by the press, from government censorship disguised as an attempt to combat bias. But one justice’s concurrence raises some troubling questions about the First Amendment’s application to the TikTok ban case.</p>

        <h2>The government says it won’t prosecute ‘real’ journalists. Don’t believe it</h2>
        <p>We’ve spent the week warning that Julian Assange’s guilty plea — although better than an adverse court ruling — dangerously legitimizes the idea that the government can convict journalists under the Espionage Act for publishing its secrets.

            It’s something past administrations have dreamed of doing, but chickened out because it would have been unprecedented. It’s not anymore, just in time for a potential second Trump term, during which he’d love nothing more than to throw journalists in jail.</p>

        <h2>Government refuses to learn its lesson on censorship</h2>
        <p>From Los Angeles to Tennessee, public officials who should know better keep ignoring journalists' First Amendment rights. These are just the latest examples of an alarming trend that shows no signs of slowing.

            You can't spell SLAPP without LA
            
            The City of LA is paying $300,000 to settle a frivolous lawsuit it initiated to stop a journalist, Ben Camacho, from publishing pictures of police officers that the city itself gave him.
            
            It’s hard to imagine the city’s lawyers didn’t know the lawsuit was a baseless SLAPP, or Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation, from the outset. The rule against “prior restraints” barring the press from publishing information is virtually ironclad, especially when the government itself inadvertently released the information in question.</p>

        <h2>Coalition demands authorities drop prosecution of Oregon journalist</h2>
        <p>A coalition of press freedom groups sent a letter to Oregon’s Multnomah County District Attorney Mike Schmidt, demanding that he drop a criminal trespass charge against Portland photojournalist Alissa Azar.

            Azar was covering a pro-Palestinian protest at Portland State University on May 2, 2024, when officers shoved her to the ground and arrested her, despite her press credentials from the National Press Photographers Association. The initial hearing is scheduled for this Friday, June 7.</p>

        <h2>Federal law must fix loophole allowing abusive lawsuits targeting speech</h2>
        <p>
            Recent lawsuits against liberal and conservative outlets alike based on their reporting show the need for a federal law counteracting strategic lawsuits against public participation, or SLAPPs, Freedom of the Press Foundation (FPF) Deputy Director of Advocacy Caitlin Vogus wrote for The Hill.

As Vogus wrote:

"Many states — both red and blue — have made clear that they want to protect their citizens’ freedom of speech from meritless litigation. It’s time for Congress to act to ensure that federal courts don’t thwart those protections. It’s time to pass a federal anti-SLAPP law."

        <h2>Media Matters layoffs underscore need to crack down on SLAPPs</h2>
        <p>Media Matters for America announced yesterday that it’s laying off at least a dozen staffers. Its president blamed a “legal assault on multiple fronts,” including a lawsuit by Elon Musk’s X and the legal actions by Republican state attorneys general that followed.

            “This is the latest example of billionaires and pandering politicians abusing the legal system to retaliate against their critics and harm the public’s right to know. The result is that the American public loses access to information in a critical election year,” said Freedom of the Press Foundation (FPF) Director of Advocacy Seth Stern</p>

        <h2>Israel’s seizure of AP equipment shows slippery slope of censorship</h2>
        <p>Freedom of the Press Foundation (FPF) Director of Advocacy Seth Stern wrote for The Hill about why Israel’s recent seizure of equipment from the Associated Press previews what might soon be coming to the U.S.

            "Fortunately, Israel quickly reversed course after pressure from the U.S. and press organizations. But the ordeal should serve as a cautionary tale for President Biden and U.S. lawmakers and prosecutors. They keep empowering future administrations to harass the media — apparently trusting them, against all historical evidence, to use restraint."</p>
